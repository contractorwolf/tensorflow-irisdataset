# TensorFlow Estimators with the Iris Dataset

This project processes the Iris Dataset from a CSV file into a model.  I had used several examples online and found few that 
were using the new TensorFlow Estimator all the way from CSV file into a saved Model.  I decided to combine what I had learned from each into a simple 
example focusing on processing and converting data, loading into a DNN Classifier, and saving and testing the model.
